# Points and comparison

## Summary

For this library, we need to be able to compare the `start` and the `end` of intervals with each other, and with
individual _points_. We require that all points we need to compare are ‚Äúof the same type‚Äù.

This library:

- does not compare values if one of the values is `undefined` or `null`; `undefined` and `null` values represent ‚Äúdon't
  know ü§∑‚Äù.
- never tests for equality with `===` or `==`
- compares values with the optional `compareFn` function parameter, if it is given
- if no `compareFn` function parameter is given, compares values with `<`
  - when `¬¨(a < b) ‚àß ¬¨(b < a)`, `a` and `b` are considered equal
  - we do not use `>`; `a > b` is calculated as `b < a`
- a `compareFn` function parameter is mandatory when one of the points to compare is `NaN` or a `symbol`

When `undefined` or `null` values are used as points, they represent ‚Äúdon't know ü§∑‚Äù.

## Strict total order

To be able to compare points of a certain type, the type has to have a
[strict total order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total¬¨_order) ‚®Ä (where the symbol ‚®Ä represents a generic operator). ‚®Ä
has to be _irreflexive_, _transitive_, and _connected_ (a.k.a. _total_):

|                   | definition                                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| irreflexive       | ‚àÄ a ‚àà T: ¬¨ (a ‚®Ä a)                         |
| transitive        | ‚àÄ a, b, c ‚àà T: (a ‚®Ä b) ‚àß (b ‚®Ä c) ‚áí (a ‚®Ä c) |
| connected (total) | ‚àÄ a, b ‚àà T: a ‚â† b ‚áí (a ‚®Ä b) ‚à® (b ‚®Ä a)      |

## `<` in JavaScript

In JavaScript, `<` fullfils this requirement technically for _almost_ all possible values out-of-the-box, which might
come as a surprise.

```ts
export type LTComparablePrimitive = number | bigint | string | boolean | Function

export type LTComparable = LTComparablePrimitive | Object

typeof < === (a: LTComparable, b: LTComparable) => boolean | undefined
```

JavaScript, allows `<` comparison between _any_ 2 values of _any_ type (except `symbol`s) because of _type coercion_,
and returns `true` or `false` (except when one of the values is, or is coerced to, `undefined` or `NaN`). The algorithm
is described at [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Less_than).

This library will never compare `null` or `undefined`. In this library, we only compare values of the same type, and the
rest of this discussion is limited to that case.

- the comparison of two `number` values is intuitive, except for `NaN` values; when either value is `NaN`, the result is
  `undefined`
  ([ECMAScript¬Æ2023 Language Specification; 6.1.6.1.12 Number::lessThan (x, y)](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-numeric-types-number-lessThan))

  ```ts
  < (a: number, b: number) => boolean | undefined
  ```

- the comparison of two `bigint` values is intuitive
  ([ECMAScript¬Æ2023 Language Specification; 6.1.6.2.12 BigInt::lessThan (x, y)](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-numeric-types-bigint-lessThan))

  ```ts
  < (a: bigint, b: bigint) => boolean
  ```

- the comparison of two `string` values is intuitive; `''` is the smallest possible value

  ```ts
  < (a: string, b: string) => boolean
  ```

- `false < true`
  ```ts
  < (a: boolean, b: boolean) => boolean
  ```

What is left, is the comparison of `object`s (including arrays), `function`s, and `symbol`s.

`object`s are coerced to `number`s, `bigint`s, or `string`s (by `@@toPrimitive()`, `valueOf()`, `toNumber()`,
or`toString()` ‚Äî
[ECMAScript¬Æ2023 Language Specification; 7.2.13 IsLessThan (x, y, LeftFirst)](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-islessthan)).
This results in the expected primitive types, which behave intuitively, for wrapper objects (`Number`,
`BigInt`,`String`, `Boolean`), and in `number` for `Date` (ms since epoch).

All other `object`s do produce a comparison result, but this is hardly intuitive, unless you explicitly code a
`@@toPrimitive()`, `valueOf()` `toNumber()`, or `toString()` method. As a result of the coercion, all generic `objects`s
are considered equal (both `a < b` and `b < a` return `false`). Arrays are also objects, and comparison ‚Äúworks‚Äù, but via
string comparison. This gives weird results. E.g., `[1, 3] < [2, 3]` is `true`, but `[2] < [11]` is `false`. `function`s
are comparable with `<`, and give more reasonable results out-of-the-box, because the source code is compared as a
string. The coercion can be manipulated by overriding `@@toPrimitive()`, `valueOf()` `toNumber()`, or `toString()`.

`symbol`s fail with a `TypeError`. JavaScript tries to coerce the `symbol`, and that is not supported. It is not
possbible to override the `@@toPrimitive()`, `valueOf()` `toNumber()`, or `toString()` method of a `symbol`. `symbols`
cannot be compared, nor be made to be comparable, with `<`.

## Equality

Comparing primitive values of the same type with `===` or `==` behaves intuitively.

Comparing `object`s, including `Date`s, with `===` or `==` is not guaranteed to give the expected results. Depending on
the way you use the `object`s, 2 different `object`s (`!==`) can represent the same point. The equality comparison
evaluates reference equality, not semantic equality.

Therefor, this library never compares values with the `===` or `==` (or `!==`, or `!=`) operators. Instead, because the
order is connected (total), `object`s are considered equal when `¬¨(a < b) ‚àß ¬¨(b < a)`:

```
  ‚àÄ a, b ‚àà T: a ‚â† b ‚áí (a ‚®Ä b) ‚à® (b ‚®Ä a)
‚áî ‚àÄ a, b ‚àà T: a = b ‚à® ((a ‚®Ä b) ‚à® (b ‚®Ä a))
‚áî ‚àÄ a, b ‚àà T: ((a ‚®Ä b) ‚à® (b ‚®Ä a)) ‚à® a = b
‚áî ‚àÄ a, b ‚àà T: ¬¨ ((a ‚®Ä b) ‚à® (b ‚®Ä a)) ‚áí a = b
‚áî ‚àÄ a, b ‚àà T: (¬¨ (a ‚®Ä b) ‚àß ¬¨ (b ‚®Ä a)) ‚áí a = b
```

## `compareFn<T>`

Operations that use comparison feature an optional function parameter `compareFn` that you _must_ supply when points can
be `NaN`, or are `symbol`s, and can supply in other cases.

```ts
type Comparator<T> = (t1: T, t2: T) => number
```

The `compare` method and function have the traditional semantics, where

- a negative number is returned when `this`, respectively `a`, is considered smaller than `other`,respectively `b`,
- a positive number when `this`, respectively `a`, is considered larger than `other`,respectively `b`, and
- `0` when both objects are considered equal.

The function may never return `NaN`.

Note that it is the implementation's responsibility to make sure the order is connected (total).

## `ltComparator<T>`

This library compares points with `ltComparator<T>` if no explicit `compareFn<T>` is given as parameter.

```ts
function ltComparator<LTComparable> (t1: T, t2: T): number
```

`ltComparator<T>` compares 2 points with `<`.

The preconditions for this function are

- that the values must be ‚Äúof the same type‚Äù.
- that the values cannot be `NaN` or a `symbol`, and

Using this default is the right choice in most sensible cases, where points are represented by `number`s, `string`s, or
`Date`s.

## Of the same type

This library is limited to compare points ‚Äúof the same type‚Äù.

For primitive values (`number`, `bigint`, `string`, `boolean`) this means `typeof t1 === typeof t2`.

For `object`s, this means they have to have a common ‚Äúmost specialized common supertype‚Äù. Finally, `Object` is a common
supertype of all `object`s. So all `object`s are ‚Äúof the same type‚Äù. This creates a challenge for `Date`, which is an
important `object` subtype for this library. Users would expect to only compare `Date`s with other `Date`s, but in fact
they can be compared with any other `object` (but probably not with the expected semantics). Because we do not want to
exclude mixed usage of `Date`s with, e.g., `moment.js` `object`s, this is up to the user.

The library user can override the `@@toPrimitive()`, `valueOf()` `toNumber()`, or `toString()` methods of `function`
instances, as they can for any `object`. It is impossible in JavaScript to create subtypes of `Function` that are still
`Callable`, but a library user might set things up to compare `function` instances with other `function` instances or
`object`s. Therefor, `function` instances are threathed as any other `object`, and, `function` instances are considered
‚Äúof the same type‚Äù as other `function` instances, and finally any other `object`.

When using TypeScript, the library user can limit the ‚Äúcommon type‚Äù more using generics.

## Don't know ü§∑

`undefined` and `null` represent _don't know ü§∑_. We advise to use `undefined`, or not to have a `start` or `end`
property present in an interval to express this, and leave `null` well alone.

## Advise on points and comparison

We advise to use `number`s (except `NaN`), `string`s (ISO-formatted), or `Date`s to represent points.

If you must use non-`Date` `object`s, arrays, or `function`s as representations of points, consider overriding
`valueOf`, or make the comparison explicit with the optional `compareFn` parameter.
